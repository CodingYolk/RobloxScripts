# Roblox Scripts

This houses a few of the Roblox scripts (luau) I have released to the public. Mainly, these serve just as examples of work, so I have not included the majority of the ones I have put out there.

_**GamepadSwordFighting**_ is a script that makes it easier for someone to sword fight on Roblox while using a gamepad; it gives them the ability to autoclick and shiftlock, amongst other things.

_**ChatTags**_ is a script that allows a player to have a tag when they chat, showing a Roblox group rank.

_**KeyBinds**_ is a script that gives a player two keybinds: one to play a salute animation and one to play an at-ease animation.

_**OwnerTag**_ is a script that will give a Roblox private server owner a chat tag stating they are the private server owner.

_**Logger**_ is a script that will log when a player joins, it will then use a Discord Webhook API to then relay that log to a discord server.
