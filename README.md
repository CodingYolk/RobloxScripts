# Roblox Scripts


This repository showcases a selection of my publicly released Roblox scripts written in Luau. While it doesn't encompass the entirety of my work, these scripts serve as previous work examples.

_**ChatTags:**_ Empowers players to display a Roblox group rank tag when they chat, adding a visual element to their in-game presence.

_**KeyBinds:**_ Offers players the convenience of two keybinds, enabling them to trigger a salute animation and an at-ease animation with ease.

_**OwnerTag:**_ Provides private server owners on Roblox with a distinctive chat tag, highlighting their role as the server's proprietor.

_**Logger:**_ Keeps track of player joins and utilizes the Discord Webhook API to relay this information to a designated Discord server, enhancing server administration and communication.
